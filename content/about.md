## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹ 

![Francesco Bianco](https://github.com/francescobianco.png#style=float:left;width:128px)

My name is Francesco Bianco and I am an computer engineer living in a small town in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily). 
In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and mathematics, and I am also the president of the local chess club. 
In addition to these passions, I also have a strong interest in CI/CD technologies, 
and enjoy designing and building tools using the BASH language. Throughout my professional career, 
I have gained a wealth of experience working with open-source CRM systems.
