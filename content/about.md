Hello! My name is Francesco Bianco and I am an computer engineer living in a small town in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily). In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and mathematics, and I am also the president of the local chess club. In addition to these passions, I also have a strong interest in CI/CD technologies, and enjoy designing and building tools using the BASH language. Throughout my professional career, I have gained a wealth of experience working with open-source CRM systems.
