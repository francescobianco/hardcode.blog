## Hello World! 

![Francesco Bianco](https://github.com/francescobianco.png#style=float:left;width:64px)

ðŸ‘‹ My name is Francesco Bianco and I am an computer engineer living in a small town in [Sicily](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sicily). 
In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and mathematics, and I am also the president of the local chess club. 
In addition to these passions, I also have a strong interest in CI/CD technologies, 
and enjoy designing and building tools using the BASH language. Throughout my professional career, 
I have gained a wealth of experience working with open-source CRM systems.

### What is HARDCODE.BLOG?

This blog was born as a side project aimed at building my personal brand and showcasing my expertise. 
Over time, it evolved into something more profound. I realized that a blog for IT professionals should offer more 
â€“ it should be deeply connected to its subject matter, becoming a tool in itself, not just a trivial repository of articles.

I hope that users of our blog understand this vision and appreciate the effort to create content that goes beyond mere reading,
allowing interaction with new modalities. The motto is simple: this is not just a blog, but a software platform you are using.
